## Deliverables

All of the deliverable documents are in the [deliverable](deliverables) sub directory.

The mock up of our application is in the [Rough_Mockup.pdf](deliverables/Artifacts/Rough_Mockup.pdf) file under the deliverables sub directory. You must download it and run it on your local machine to be able to use the interactive features, since GitHub
cannot render these correctly.

## Code

All of the code are under the [AndroidApp](AndroidApp) sub directory.
