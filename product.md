 Our product is a misc. job finding app. We are helping unemployed people and people who want extra money finding temporary jobs and clients getting random tasks done. We plan on building an Android mobile app. Which brings workers and clients without going through a employer. One use case would be a student where they have a free weekend and they are looking for extra cash, they could go turn on the app and find someone that is looking for work without much hassle. Or someone who is looking for a job in their field and needs something in the meantime, they can use the app and, for example, assemble a clientâ€™s new furniture they just bought from IKEA.
