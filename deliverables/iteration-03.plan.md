# Halp


## Iteration 3

 * Start date: 2018-11-13
 * End date: 2018-11-30

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

 * Have a scrum master
 * We will have a more detailed board
 * Due to the heavy workload out core tasks create and the limited time the team has due to our other classes having closer deadlines, we have decided to get rid of the decline job option and the schedule, so we can focus on our core features.

#### Roles & responsibilities

- Kyle: Front End Programmer

- Arjun: Front End Programmer

- Xun: Front End Programmer

- Brandon: Front End Programmer, Back End Programmer and Review Meeting Writer

- Mat(Peijun): Lead Back End Programmer, Planning Meeting Writer

- Pablo: Front End Programmer, Mockup Programmer, Planning Meeting Writer and Review Meeting Writer

Each individual is responsible for coding a working version of one or more of the tasks that were created during this planning meeting. In addition, Pablo and Mat are responsible for writing up the planning meeting document along with deciding the database, architecture and their diagrams, with Brandon coming in to help so the three make decisions on the tasks to be implemented.

#### Events

 * The initial planning meeting will be on 2018-11-16, it will be in person in MyHal.
 * The purpose of this meeting is to come up with tasks for the 3rd deliverable,
 and most importantly tasks for the back end of our application
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       
 
 * https://github.com/csc301-fall-2018/project-team-22/projects/1
    * We will use the built in To-Do List and progress tracker on GitHub in order to organize  
    * This list allows people to assign themselves tasks and for the entire team to keep track of the progress of all the tasks as well as contribute themselves to tasks that were not assigned to them if help is needed.
    
 * Discord Server
    * We will use the discord app the same way we used it for the first deliverable, as a way to communicate with each other outside of our in-person meetings. Something we might consider doing is using the voice chat feature of the app in order to hold meetings when not everyone is able to meet in person.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

 * Milestones are used to help set a pace for the workload and tasks being done on time.
 * How people would work on the repo would either be branching from the repo or forking and cloning a local copy of the repo onto their local machine.
 * Any new code that would be added to the master repo would either be merged from a branch or a fork. A peer will review the code and make sure there are no typos and, if there are no conflicts, approve the pull request.
 * In the event of a merge conflict, the code reviewer will resolve the conflicts manually. If the conflict is too complicated to resolve with one person, the reviewer will request for help from the group and then make the decision which version to proceed with.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Back End:
   * Implement a RESTful API using JSON as the data format.
   * Implement a Controller for back end to fetch data from Persistence and send it to the view as JSON.
   * Implement Persistence for talking to the database.
   * Implement the Core of the back end, handling any computation by the controller.
   * Implement a Temporary State to keep track of temporal data (e.g searching for worker, etc.)
 
 * Front End:
   * Implement a Controller for front end to get data from the HTTP adapter and push it to the GUI.
   * Implement the HTTP adapter to fetch data from back end and to the controller.
   * Implement a Session Storage to store temporary data for the current user session.
 
 * Flesh out the front end of our application, make it look better
