# Team 22

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2018-10-12 4pm
 * Where: Myhal 5th floor

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- we agreed on the most features in this app
- we agreed on the enviroument(java/android)
- we agreed on the communication tools

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

- if we should have 2 interfaces for client/worker or 2 different apps
- more wireframe
- time conflict for meeting


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

- we will polish the features(add/delete based on skills)


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

-Rough idea of what we want to build

-Find the tech stack we want to work with (java, android studio)

-Determine target users

-Organize communication and board

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

-More detailed idea of the app

-Wire frames or mock ups

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

-We want to make sure we organize better and stay in contact more. We were all pretty busy outside of this class, 
so we need to make sure out meetings are productive and effective. 

-We want to try to produce more artifacts during our next sprint. We need to start working on the mock ups and 
begin coding. 

-Improve communication, and start using our board and issue tracker more effectively.
