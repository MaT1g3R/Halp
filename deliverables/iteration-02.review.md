# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

Review meeting will occur on November 2, in person in Myhal's Atrium.

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
 We used a [GitHub planning board](Artifacts/Board.png) to assign tasks to members and see what functions have not been implemented yet. This allowed us to know exactly who was working on what tasks and showed us how much workload we had left (by number of issues left) and gave us a physical view of exactly how much progress we had done so far.
 
 To communicate we decided on making a discord server. This helped us communicate in an environment that no confusion as to who was talking was created, as well as allowed us to have our audio meeting for people who were not able to make it in person.
 
 We used branches so that everyone could code their own task while avoiding conflicts and making sure the code was perfect before being pushed to master. For trivial changes, however, like typos and small bug fixes we did not use branches, but me coordinated on the discord chat to make sure only one person was working on master at a time.
 
 Everyone used Android Studio for the project, making sure everyone was working on the same environment, making it easier to solve problems. We also used the same resolution and emulator for the Android device for the same reasons.
 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
 We allowed everyone to choose their own tickets, causing a disarray with deadlines. This caused a delay on issue completion and forced us to work on leftover functions on November 2, rather than having it done by the intended date. This could have been avoided if we had a scrum master to check on everyone, but we did not.
 
 Our tickets were too vague and didn't really specify a particular feature. We didn't have specifics as to what needed to be done and everyone had to refer to our Mockup to make sure they understood what the ticket meant.
 
 We didn't have any unit tests, forcing everyone to manually check if every feature worked like it was intended. This resulted in wasted time going forward, being a reason why we didn't finish everything by the deadline we set. Going forward, we intend to have unit test for next deliverable, since we are coding the back end which requires more testing than the front end.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

We are going to have a scrum master from now on. As stated above, we already experienced the consequences not having one. Therefore, in order to meet our deadlines and making sure everyone is keeping up with the workload, we will assign someone to be the scrum master.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 
 We implemented all the features we planned on doing. 


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
   
  This wasn't a plan, but it was something we would've liked to implement after all our goals were met. We wanted to have a login authentication process, checking that the user exists and enters the right password. However, since we didn't meet our goals early enough, we were not able to implement this feature.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
 
 Better organization. A scrum master would definitely help meeting deadlines and helping us get work done. 
 
 Implement tests. As stated earlier, this is a necessity we will have for later iterations in order to use our time efficiently instead of wasting it manually changing, and would help us to avoid missing corner cases.
 
 Better tickets. Our tickets were too vague, so by using better tickets (more accurate and descriptive) we will, again, use our time more efficiently. This will result in a bigger number of tickets, but by being more descriptive and smaller in workload, this won't be a problem.
