#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * Initial planning meeting will occur on October 06. This meeting will be in person. The purpose of this meeting will be to flesh out what we want to get done for this deliverable, including coming up with tasks and deciding how far we want to go for this deliverable.
 * Secondary planning meeting will occur on October 13. This meeting will be held in person. The purpose of this meeting is to finalize all the tasks for this deliverable and start assigning tasks. Also meant to catch up members of the team who were not present at the first planning meeting
 * Progress meeting will occur on October 26. This meeting will be held in person. The purpose of this meeting is to check on the progress of the deliverable, see where everyone is at with their tasks, as well as plan what we are going to do with our demo video.
 * Second progress meeting will occur on October 27. This meeting will be held online on discord. The purpose of this meeting is to catch up on anyone who was not able to make the first progress meeting as well as finalize the script for our demo video
 * Review meeting will occur on November 2. This meeting will be held in person. We will go over the app, making sure everything is done and ready to be submitted, as well as recording the video for submition.
 
#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts. You must incorporate 'Pull Requests' into your process. 

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
